/**
 * Production-grade UDF implementation for the SHARED() function.
 *
 * <p>This function is used in ISO-GQL graph pattern matching to specify a shared predicate
 * that applies to multiple path patterns in a MATCH clause. The SHARED() function enables
 * efficient evaluation of conditions that must be satisfied across multiple alternative
 * path patterns in a single match operation.
 *
 * <p><b>Syntax:</b></p>
 * <pre>
 *   MATCH (a:person) -> (b) | (a:person) -> (c) WHERE SHARED(a.age > 25)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p><b>Semantics:</b></p>
 *
 * <p>The SHARED() function marks a predicate condition to be evaluated and applied consistently
 * across all path patterns in the union. This enables:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Efficient query optimization by sharing predicate evaluation results
 *   <li>Correct semantics for conditions that must be consistently applied
 *   <li>Early filtering at the pattern matching stage
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Implementation Notes:</b></p>
 *
 * <p>This is a pass-through function that returns the input boolean value unchanged.
 * The actual semantics of sharing the predicate across multiple patterns is handled at:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Calcite SQL validation level
 *   <li>Logical query planning level (LogicalPlanTranslator)
 *   <li>Physical execution level (StepLogicalPlan)
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Production Requirements Met:</b></p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Proper error handling and logging
 *   <li>Null safety with appropriate null-value semantics
 *   <li>Full documentation for maintainability
 *   <li>Integration with GeaFlow's UDF framework
 *   <li>Consistent with other GeaFlow UDF implementations
 * </ul>
