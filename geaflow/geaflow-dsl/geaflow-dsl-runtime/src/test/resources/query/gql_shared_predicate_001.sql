-- Test Case: Basic shared Functionality
-- Purpose: Verify the fundamental shared syntax and functionality
-- Query: (a:person) -> (b) | (a:person) -> (c) WHERE SHARED(a.age > 25)
-- Description: This test validates that the basic shared pattern works correctly
-- by finding person vertices that have age greater than 25 and connecting them to
-- two different target vertices through separate path patterns.
-- Expected: Returns person vertices with age > 25 and their connected vertices b and c

CREATE TABLE tbl_result (
  a_id bigint,
  a_age int,
  b_id bigint,
  c_id bigint
) WITH (
	type='file',
	geaflow.dsl.file.path='${target}'
);

USE GRAPH modern;

INSERT INTO tbl_result
SELECT
	a_id,
  a_age,
  b_id,
  c_id
FROM (
  MATCH (a:person) -> (b) | (a:person) -> (c) WHERE SHARED(a.age > 25)
  RETURN a.id as a_id, a.age as a_age, b.id as b_id, c.id as c_id
)
