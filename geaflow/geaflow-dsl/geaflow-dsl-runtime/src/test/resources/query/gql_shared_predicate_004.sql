-- Test Case: shared with Edge Conditions
-- Purpose: Verify shared functionality with edge property conditions
-- Query: (a:person) -[e1:knows]-> (b) | (a:person) -[e2:created]-> (c) WHERE SHARED(e1.weight > 0.5)
-- Description: This test validates that shared can handle conditions on edge properties.
-- It ensures that edge conditions are properly shared across different path patterns
-- and that edge properties are correctly evaluated in the shared predicate.
-- Expected: Returns person vertices connected via knows edges with weight > 0.5 and created edges
