-- Test Case: shared with Multiple Path Patterns
-- Purpose: Verify shared functionality with three path patterns
-- Query: (a:person) -> (b) | (a:person) -> (c) | (a:person) -> (d) WHERE SHARED(a.age > 25)
-- Description: This test validates that shared can handle more than two path patterns.
-- It ensures that the shared condition is properly applied to all three path patterns
-- and that the result set includes vertices from all three patterns.
-- Expected: Returns person vertices with age > 25 and their connected vertices b, c, and d
