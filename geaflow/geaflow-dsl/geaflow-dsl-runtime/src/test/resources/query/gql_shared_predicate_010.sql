-- Test Case: shared with Vertex Type Conditions
-- Purpose: Verify shared functionality with different vertex types
-- Query: (a:person) -> (b:person) | (a:person) -> (c:software) WHERE SHARED(a.age > 25)
-- Description: This test validates that shared works correctly when path patterns
-- target different vertex types (person and software). It ensures that vertex type filtering
-- is properly handled in conjunction with shared conditions.
-- Expected: Returns person vertices with age > 25 connected to both person and software vertices
