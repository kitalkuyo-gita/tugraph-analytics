-- Test Case: shared with Complex Arithmetic Expressions
-- Purpose: Verify shared functionality with arithmetic operations
-- Query: (a:person) -> (b) | (a:person) -> (c) WHERE SHARED(a.age * 2 > 50)
-- Description: This test validates that shared can handle complex arithmetic
-- expressions in conditions. It ensures that mathematical operations are properly
-- evaluated and that the result is correctly applied to both path patterns.
-- Expected: Returns person vertices where age * 2 > 50 (i.e., age > 25)
