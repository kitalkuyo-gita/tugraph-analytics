-- Test Case: shared with String Conditions
-- Purpose: Verify shared functionality with string comparison
-- Query: (a:person) -> (b) | (a:person) -> (c) WHERE SHARED(a.name = 'marko')
-- Description: This test validates that shared can handle string comparison
-- conditions. It ensures that string literals and string properties are properly
-- compared and that the condition is correctly applied to both path patterns.
-- Expected: Returns person vertices with name 'marko' and their connected vertices
